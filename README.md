# Dragon-curve
A simple program in python that allows you to create simple or more complicated dragon curve patterns.\n
A work in progress.\n
I plan on improving run time,\n 
changing complexity increase and decrease algorithm \n
              (Instead of just adding onto the path from the same location, I want the pattern to be visibly based on the previous pattern rather than it looking like the path got copy and pasted from the previous pattern)  \n
              (Have it similar to drawing the dragon curve in real life)
\n
This program requires having pygame downloaded. \n
\n
Controls of interface is: \n
up arrow: move the pattern up \n
down arrow: move the patter down \n
right arrow: move the pattern right \n
left arrow: move the pattern left \n

char c: increase complexity \n
char d: decrease complexity \n
char i: zoom in \n
char o: zoom out \n
