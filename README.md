# Dragon-curve
A simple program in python that allows you to create simple or more complicated dragon curve patterns.\
### A work in progress.\
I plan on improving run time,\
changing complexity increase and decrease algorithm \
              (Instead of just adding onto the path from the same location, I want the pattern to be visibly based on the previous pattern rather than it looking like the path got copy and pasted from the previous pattern)  \
              (Have it similar to drawing the dragon curve in real life)
\
This program requires having pygame downloaded. \
\
### Controls of interface is: \
up arrow: move the pattern up \
down arrow: move the patter down \
right arrow: move the pattern right \
left arrow: move the pattern left \ 

char c: increase complexity \
char d: decrease complexity \
char i: zoom in \
char o: zoom out \
